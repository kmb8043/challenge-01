# Module 01, Challenge 01 #

## Overview ##

This is a site for the marketing agency Horiseon. For this challenge I was give an existing code with a goal to optimize the site. 



## Discription ##

The site was already up and running, it only needed a little sprusing up to fix the language and a navigation error. 
My goal was to make the HTML easier to read. I did this by replacing some of the language in the HTML; replacing the non-semantic language with semantic. 
I also organized the CSS and added in comments. The comments made the CSS easier to navigate through.
