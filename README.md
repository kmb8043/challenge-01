# Module 01, Challenge 01 #

## Overview ##

This is a website for the marketing agency, Horiseon. For this challenge, I was given an existing code with a goal to optimize the website. 


## Description ##

The website was already up and running. I fixed the HTML language and a navigation errors to opimize the website. 
My goal was to make the HTML easier to read. I did this by making changes to the language in the HTML. I removed the non-semantic tags and replaced them with semantic.
I added comments in the CSS making it easier to navigate and read. 
 
 ## Usage ##

Horiseon is an agency marketing website with information on how to grow and market your company.
